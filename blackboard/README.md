This course shows the basic steps to access, capture and store the waze data, and the best, how to apply it in practical mobility analysis.

With the videos, notebooks and additional materials contained in the course, you'll see how to get and use the data (those shown in the app) generated in real time by the Waze community and its more than 100 million users world-wide. You wil not need special skills or knowledge for it, so you don't need to be a data analyst or a computer expet to do it, and also will not need a big infrastrsture of IT. You just need a computer to access the course and process the data, enough hard dsk or cloud space to store as much data as you want and a lot of wll to join the IOT applied to mobility. Here you will see from the very beggining, step by step and using open source softwares and platforms, how to build the database, data views, and analysis for traffic jams, accidents and hazard reports, and ideas for advanced analysis and possibilities for Waze data usage for cities.

So if you are a traffic manager or operator, a mobility data interested, a smart thinkig and city engaged or interested in developing new ideas to improve your community life and mobility, be very welcome.
